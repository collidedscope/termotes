# Termotes

**Termotes** is a Crystal library that draws Twitch emotes right in your terminal (even animated ones!). It does so with the Unicode block elements ▀ and ▄ (and an assumption that your terminal supports 24-bit color).

The example `montage` program is provided to demonstrate basic usage and results.
